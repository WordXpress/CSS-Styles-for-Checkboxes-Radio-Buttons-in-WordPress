# CSS-Styles-for-Checkboxes-Radio-Buttons-in-WordPress
Various CSS for restyling all checkboxes and radio buttons in WordPress (should work on other sites too).

Just open the CSS file you need. Each has styling for any checkboxes and radio buttons where the label immediately follows the input, plus a special exception WooCommerce's terms checkbox.

**Note: If your plugin or theme puts the "input" inside the "label" element for checkboxes and radio buttons, please correct this. They should be siblings, with the "input" immediately followed by the "label".**
